# Live-Chess-Engine

Issues
- model accuracy kinda shit
- stockfish engine not working
-  <strike>board transformation doesn't detect all squares (maybe try change add padding parameters) - avg (42-list index out of range) <strike>
-  <strike>frame keeps rotating for some reason (due to detecting other lines)<strike>
